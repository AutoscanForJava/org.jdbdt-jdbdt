# JDBDT 

JDBDT (Java DataBase Delta Testing) is a Java library for 
testing database applications, helping you conduct
database setup and verification.
The main features are as follows:

* Data sets are defined programmatically, and be used
for database setup or verification.
There is no need to maintain external files, data sets 
are an integral part of test specifications. 
* &delta;-assertions can be used to verify 
database changes incrementally, in addition to standard
full-state assertions.
* Setup methods can be used to manage the contents of database
tables, through insertions, clean-up operations, and 
save-points.
