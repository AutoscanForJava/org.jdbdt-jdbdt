JDBDT is developed and maintained by [Eduardo R. B. Marques](http://www.dcc.fc.up.pt/~edrdo).

The author felt the need of a novel software library 
for the automation of database setup and validation in test code,
in alternative to existing ones such as [DBUnit](http://dbunit.sourceforge.net) or [DBSetup](http://dbsetup.ninja-squad.com),
while teaching a [software testing course](https://moodle-arquivo.ciencias.ulisboa.pt/1415/course/view.php?id=1980) at [DI/FCUL](http://www.di.fc.ul.pt). 

An early prototype of JDBDT was used by [DI/FCUL](http://www.di.fc.ul.pt) students during 2015. The library subsequently evolved onto a more mature form and was released as open-source software in 2016.
