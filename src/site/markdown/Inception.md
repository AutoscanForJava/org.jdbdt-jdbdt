JDBDT is developed and maintained by [Eduardo R. B. Marques](http://www.dcc.fc.up.pt/~edrdo).

The author felt the need for a novel library 
for the automation of database setup and validation (assertions) in test code, while teaching a [software testing course](https://moodle-arquivo.ciencias.ulisboa.pt/1415/course/view.php?id=1980) at [DI/FCUL](http://www.di.fc.ul.pt), as an alternative to other existing tools such as <a href="http://dbunit.sourceforge.net">DBUnit</a> or <a href="http://dbsetup.ninja-squad.com">DBSetup</a>

 An early prototype of JDBDT was used by  students in Lisbon during 2015. The library subsequently evolved onto a more mature form and was released as open-source software
in 2016. Students at <a href="http://www.dcc.fc.up.pt">DCC/FCUP</a> have recently used JDBDT in project assignments for the <a href="http://www.dcc.fc.up.pt/~edrdo/QSES1617">QSES</a> course.
