JDBDT is developed and maintained by [Eduardo R. B. Marques](http://www.dcc.fc.up.pt/~edrdo).
The author felt the need for a novel database testing library, while teaching 
a software testing course at the [University of Lisbon](http://www.di.fc.ul.pt).
An early prototype of JDBDT was used by MSc students in Lisbon during 2015. 
The library subsequently evolved onto a more mature form and was released as open-source software
in 2016.
