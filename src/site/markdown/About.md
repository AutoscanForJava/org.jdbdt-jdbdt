# About JDBDT

JDBDT is developed and maintained by [Eduardo R. B. Marques](http://www.dcc.fc.up.pt/~edrdo).
The author felt the need for a novel database testing library, while  teaching 
a software testing course at the [University of Lisbon](http://www.di.fc.ul.pt), 
given the shortcomings of existing tools. 
An early prototype of JDBDT was used by MSc students at Lisbon in 2015. Subsequently, the library evolved onto a more mature form and was released open-source.
